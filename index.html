                    <p><br>Hi, I am Bhavi Patel, recent computer science graduate from University of California, Davis and looking
                        forward to embark my career as a Software Engineer. 
                        I am a continuous improver, troubleshooter, completer and organized person. 
                        I was born in India and moved to the United States of America in 2016, to get more opportunities and build my computer science career. 
                        I love to code and debug programs which made me chose computer science as my major. Additionally, along with coding I am interested in sports. 
                        I used to play handball in high school in India.</p>

                        <p>AtHum is the AI interior designer for real estate. AtHum is adding a new feature to their remote office application. 
                            The feature adds interactive actions to the images of properties and floorplans within the project that AtHum deploys to the customers. 
                            The interactive actions include highlighting of selected building section in the image,
                            the menu actions and displaying of callout which includes the information of the selected section and opens particular section page of the property when clicked. 
                            To start with, we are given a .svg file which include the interactive image generated by Adobe Illustrator. we needed to deliver .json file or JavaScript object 
                            notation file which includes all the actions.</p>

                        <h3>Shortest Path Finder AI Project</h3>
                        <p>The finder includes an implementation of an AIModule interface that computes a path 
                            from the start location to the end location while minimizing the total search space. 
                            The terrain map is a 2-D world layered on top of a rectangular grid. 
                            Each point in the world has a height (0 - 255). One can move to any of the eight squares adjacent 
                            to the current location. The cost to traverse between tiles depends on the differences in height 
                            between the tiles. The finder could either use Dijkstra's algorithm or Astar 
                            algorithm to find the optimal path.</p>

                            American Sign Language (ASL) is a language expressed by hand and face movements. Sign language is an essential tool to bridge

                            of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing and is used by many hearing people.
